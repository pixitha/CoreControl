# CoreControl

The only dashboard you'll ever need to manage your entire server infrastructure. Keep all your server data organized in one central place, easily add your self-hosted applications with quick access links, and monitor their availability in real-time with built-in uptime tracking. Designed for simplicity and control, it gives you a clear overview of your entire self-hosted setup at a glance.
